<p className={styles.pageDescription}>
  Goose is an open source project that is constantly being improved and expanded upon. These experimental features and projects are still in development and may not be fully stable or ready for production use, but they showcase exciting possibilities for the future of AI automation.

:::note
The list of experimental features may change as Goose development progresses. Some features may be promoted to stable features, while others might be modified or removed. This section will be updated with specific experimental features as they become available.
