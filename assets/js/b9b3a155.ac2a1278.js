Traditional detection writing involves painstaking manual processes encompassing log format and schema comprehension, intricate query creation, threat modeling, and iterative manual detection testing and refinement, leading to time expenditure and reliance on specialized expertise. This can lead to gaps in threat coverage and an overwhelming number of alerts. At Block, we face the relentless challenge of evolving threats and intricate system complexities. To stay ahead, we've embraced AI-driven solutions, notably Goose, Block\u2019s open-source AI agent, and Panther MCP, to allow the broader organization to contribute high-quality rules that are contextual to their area of expertise.
