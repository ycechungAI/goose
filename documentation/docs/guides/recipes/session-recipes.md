import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import { PanelLeft, Bot } from 'lucide-react';

Sometimes you finish a task in Goose and realize, "Hey, this setup could be useful again." Maybe you have curated a great combination of tools, defined a clear goal, and want to preserve that flow. Or maybe you're trying to help someone else replicate what you just did without walking them through it step by step. 

You can turn your current Goose session into a reusable recipe that includes the tools, goals, and setup you're using right now and package it into a new Agent that others (or future you) can launch with a single click.

  <TabItem value="generator" label="Recipe Generator">
    Use the online [Recipe Generator](https://block.github.io/goose/recipe-generator) tool to create a recipe. First choose your preferred format:

    - **URL Format**: Generates a shareable link that opens a session in the Goose Desktop app
    - **YAML Format**: Generates YAML content that you can save to file and then run in the Goose CLI app

    Then fill out the recipe form by providing:
      - A **title** for the recipe
      - A **description**
      - A set of **instructions** for the recipe.
      - An optional initial **prompt**:
        - In the Desktop app, the prompt displays in the chat box.
        - In the CLI app, the prompt provides the initial message to run. Note that a prompt is required to run the recipe in headless (non-interactive) mode.
      - A set of optional **activities** to display in the Desktop app.
      - YAML format only: Optional **author** contact information and **extensions** the recipe uses.

   #### Run a Recipe

   <Tabs groupId="interface">
     <TabItem value="local" label="Local Recipe" default>

       **Basic Usage** - Run once and exit (see [run options](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#run-options) and [recipe commands](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#recipe) for more):
       ```sh
       # Using recipe file in current directory
       goose run --recipe recipe.yaml

       # Using full path
       goose run --recipe ./recipes/my-recipe.yaml
       ```

       **Preview Recipe** - Use the [`explain`](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#run-options) command to view details before running:
 
       **Interactive Mode** - Start an interactive session:
       ```sh
       goose run --recipe recipe.yaml --interactive
       ```
       The interactive mode will prompt for required values:
       ```sh
       ◆ Enter value for required parameter 'language':
       │ Python
       │
       ◆ Enter value for required parameter 'style_guide':
       │ PEP8
       ```

       **With Parameters** - Supply parameter values when running recipes. See the [`run` command documentation](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#run-options) for detailed examples and options.

       Basic example:
       ```sh
       goose run --recipe recipe.yaml --params language=Python
       ```

     </TabItem>

     <TabItem value="github" label="GitHub Recipe">

       Once you've configured your GitHub repository, you can run recipes by name:

       **Basic Usage** - Run recipes from your configured repo using the recipe name that matches its directory (see [run options](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#run-options) and [recipe commands](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#recipe) for more):

       ```sh
       goose run --recipe recipe-name
       ```

       For example, if your repository structure is:
       ```
       my-repo/
       ├── code-review/
       │   └── recipe.yaml
       └── setup-project/
           └── recipe.yaml
       ```
       
       You would run the following command to run the code review recipe:
       ```sh
       goose run --recipe code-review
       ```

      **Preview Recipe** - Use the [`explain`](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#run-options) command to view details before running:

## Validate Recipe

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
    Recipe validation is only available through the CLI.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
    Validate your recipe file to ensure it's properly configured. Validation verifies that:
    - All required fields are present
    - Parameters are properly formatted
    - Referenced extensions exist and are valid
    - The YAML/JSON syntax is correct

   ```sh
   goose recipe validate recipe.yaml
   ```

   :::info
   If you want to validate a recipe you just created, you need to [exit the session](/docs/guides/managing-goose-sessions#exit-session) before running the [`validate` subcommand](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#recipe).
   :::

   Recipe validation can be useful for:
    - Troubleshooting recipes that aren't working as expected
    - Verifying recipes after manual edits
    - Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Share Recipe

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
    Share your recipe with Desktop users by copying the recipe URL from the recipe creation dialog. When someone clicks the URL, it will open Goose Desktop with your recipe configuration.

    To copy the recipe URL:
    1. [Open the recipe](#use-recipe)
    2. Click the <Bot className="inline" size={16} /> button at the bottom of the app 
    3. Click `View recipe`
    4. Scroll down and copy the link

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
    Share your recipe with CLI users by directly sending them the recipe file or converting it to a shareable [deep link](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#recipe) for Desktop users:

    ```sh
    goose recipe deeplink recipe.yaml
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Schedule Recipe
<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
Automate Goose recipes by running them on a schedule.

   1. Click the <PanelLeft className="inline" size={16} /> button in the top-left to open the sidebar
   2. Click `Scheduler` 
   3. Click `Create Schedule`
   3. In the dialog that appears:
      - Provide a **name** for the schedule
      - Select the **source** of your recipe. This can be either a `yaml` file or link generated by Goose Desktop.
      - Select whether you want your recipe to run in the background or foreground **execution mode**. Recipes run in the background don't open a window, but the session results are saved. Recipes run in the foreground will open a window if the Goose Desktop app is running. Otherwise, the recipe runs in the background.
      - Choose the **frequency** and **time** to run your recipe. Your selected frequency (e.g. every 20 minutes, weekly at 10 AM on Friday) is converted into a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Cron_expression) used by Goose.
      - Click `Create Schedule`

  Your new scheduled recipe is listed in the `Scheduler` page. Click on the schedule to view details, see when it was last run, and perform actions with the scheduled recipe:
    - `Run Schedule Now` to trigger the recipe manually
    - `Edit Schedule` to change the scheduled frequency
    - `Pause Schedule` to stop the recipe from running automatically. 

  At the bottom of the `Schedule Details` page you can view the list of sessions created by the scheduled recipe and open or restore each session.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
  Automate Goose recipes by scheduling them to run with a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Cron_expression).

  ```bash
  # Add a new scheduled recipe which runs every day at 9 AM
  goose schedule add --id daily-report --cron "0 0 9 * * *" --recipe-source ./recipes/daily-report.yaml
  ```
  You can use either a 5, 6, or 7-digit cron expression for full scheduling precision, following the format "seconds minutes hours day-of-month month day-of-week year".

  See the [`schedule` command documentation](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands.md#schedule) for detailed examples and options.

When scheduling Goose recipes with the CLI, you can use Goose's built-in cron scheduler (default), or the [Temporal scheduler](https://docs.temporal.io/evaluate/development-production-features/schedules) (requires the Temporal CLI). Switch from the default legacy scheduler by setting the `GOOSE_SCHEDULER_TYPE` [environment variable](/docs/guides/environment-variables.md#session-management):

  ```bash
  export GOOSE_SCHEDULER_TYPE=temporal
  ```
  Use Temporal scheduling if you want an advanced workflow engine with monitoring features. The scheduling engines do not share schedules, so schedules created with the legacy Goose scheduler cannot be run with the Temporal scheduler, and vice-versa.

## Core Components

 A recipe needs these core components:

   - **Instructions**: Define the agent's behavior and capabilities
      - Acts as the agent's mission statement
      - Makes the agent ready for any relevant task
      - Required if no prompt is provided

   - **Prompt** (Optional): Starts the conversation automatically
      - Without a prompt, the agent waits for user input
      - Useful for specific, immediate tasks
      - Required if no instructions are provided

   - **Activities**: Example tasks that appear as clickable bubbles
      - Help users understand what the recipe can do
      - Make it easy to get started

## Advanced Features

### Automated Retry Logic

Recipes can include retry logic to automatically attempt task completion multiple times until success criteria are met. This is particularly useful for:

- **Automation workflows** that need to ensure successful completion
- **Development tasks** like running tests that may need multiple attempts  
- **System operations** that require validation and cleanup

**Basic retry configuration:**
```yaml
retry:
  max_retries: 3
  checks:
    - type: shell
      command: "test -f output.txt"  # Check if output file exists
  on_failure: "rm -f temp_files*"   # Cleanup on failure
```

**How it works:**
1. Recipe executes normally with provided instructions
2. After completion, success checks validate the results
3. If validation fails and retries remain:
   - Optional cleanup command runs
   - Agent state resets to initial conditions
   - Recipe execution starts over
4. Process continues until either success or max retries reached

See the [Recipe Reference Guide](/docs/guides/recipes/recipe-reference#automated-retry-with-success-validation) for complete retry configuration options and examples.

## What's Included

A recipe captures:

- AI instructions (goal/purpose)  
- Suggested activities (examples for the user to click)  
- Enabled extensions and their configurations  
- Project folder or file context  
- Initial setup (but not full conversation history)
- The model and provider to use when running the recipe (optional)
- Retry logic and success validation configuration (if configured)


To protect your privacy and system integrity, Goose excludes:

- Global and local memory  
- API keys and personal credentials  
- System-level Goose settings  


This means others may need to supply their own credentials or memory context if the recipe depends on those elements.
