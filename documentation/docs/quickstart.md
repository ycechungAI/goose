Goose is an extensible open source AI agent enhances your software development by automating coding tasks. 

This quick tutorial will guide you through:

- ✅ Installing Goose
- ✅ Configuring your LLM
- ✅ Building a small app
- ✅ Adding an MCP server

Let's begin 🚀

## Install Goose

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS" default>
    Choose to install Goose on CLI and/or Desktop:

    <Tabs groupId="interface">
      <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
        <MacDesktopInstallButtons/>
        <div style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
          1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
          2. Run the executable file to launch the Goose Desktop application.
        </div>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
        Run the following command to install Goose:

        ```sh
        curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | bash
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    <Tabs groupId="interface">
      <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
        <LinuxDesktopInstallButtons/>
        <div style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
          **For Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions:**
          1. Download the DEB file
          2. Navigate to the directory where it is saved in a terminal
          3. Run `sudo dpkg -i (filename).deb`
          4. Launch Goose from the app menu

        </div>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
        Run the following command to install the Goose CLI on Linux:

        ```sh
        curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | bash
        ```   
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    <Tabs groupId="interface">
      <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
        <WindowsDesktopInstallButtons/>
        <div style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
          1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
          2. Run the executable file to launch the Goose Desktop application.
        </div>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
        There isn't native installation support for Windows, however you can run Goose using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

        1. Open [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows) as Administrator and install WSL and the default Ubuntu distribution:

        ```bash
        wsl --install
        ```

        2. Restart your computer if prompted.

        3. Run the Goose installation script:
        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | bash
        ```
        :::tip
          If you encounter any issues on download, you might need to install `bzip2` to extract the downloaded file:

          ```bash
          sudo apt update && sudo apt install bzip2 -y
          ```
        :::
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure Provider

Goose works with [supported LLM providers][providers]. When you install Goose, you'll be prompted to choose your preferred LLM and supply an API key.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
    ![Set Up a Provider UI](./assets/guides/set-up-provider-ui.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
    Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the CLI menu, and press Enter once you've selected a choice.

    ```
    ┌   goose-configure
    │
    ◇ What would you like to configure?
    │ Configure Providers
    │
    ◇ Which model provider should we use?
    │ Google Gemini
    │
    ◇ Provider Google Gemini requires GOOGLE_API_KEY, please enter a value

:::tip Model Selection
Goose relies heavily on tool calling capabilities and currently works best with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o (2024-11-20) model.

## Start Session
Sessions are single, continuous conversations between you and Goose. Let's start one.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
    <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
        After choosing an LLM provider, you’ll see the session interface ready for use.

        Type your questions, tasks, or instructions directly into the input field, and Goose will immediately get to work.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
        1. Make an empty directory (e.g. `goose-demo`) and navigate to that directory from the terminal.
        2. To start a new session, run:
        ```sh
        goose session
        ```

        :::tip Goose Web
        CLI users can also start a session in [Goose Web](/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands#web), a web-based chat interface:
        ```sh
        goose web --open
        ```
        :::

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Write Prompt

From the prompt, you can interact with Goose by typing your instructions exactly as you would speak to a developer.

Let's ask Goose to make a tic-tac-toe game!

```
create an interactive browser-based tic-tac-toe game in javascript where a player competes against a bot
```

Goose will create a plan and then get right to work on implementing it. Once done, your directory should contain a JavaScript file as well as an HTML page for playing.


## Install an Extension

While you're able to manually navigate to your working directory and open the HTML file in a browser, wouldn't it be better if Goose did that for you? Let's give Goose the ability to open a web browser by enabling the `Computer Controller` extension.

<Tabs groupId="interface">

    <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
        1. Locate the menu (`...`) in the top right corner of the Goose Desktop.
        2. Select `Advanced settings` from the menu.
        3. Under the `Extensions` section, toggle the `Computer Controller` extension to enable it. This [extension](https://block.github.io/goose/v1/extensions/detail/nondeveloper) enables webscraping, file caching, and automations.
        4. Scroll back to the top and click `<- Back` in the upper left corner to return to your session.
        5. Now that Goose has browser capabilities, let's ask it to launch your game in a browser:
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
        1. End the current session by entering `Ctrl+C` so that you can return to the terminal's command prompt.
        2. Run the configuration command
        ```sh
        goose configure
        ```
        3. Choose `Add extension` > `Built-in Extension` > `Computer Controller`, and set timeout to 300s. This [extension](https://block.github.io/goose/v1/extensions/detail/nondeveloper) enables webscraping, file caching, and automations.
        ```
        ┌   goose-configure
        │
        ◇  What would you like to configure?
        │  Add Extension
        │
        ◇  What type of extension would you like to add?
        │  Built-in Extension
        │
        ◇  Which built-in extension would you like to enable?
        │  ○ Developer Tools
        │  ● Computer Controller (controls for webscraping, file caching, and automations)
        │  ○ Google Drive
        │  ○ Memory
        │  ○ JetBrains
        │        
        ◇  Please set the timeout for this tool (in secs):
        │  300
        │
        └  Enabled Computer Controller extension
        ```
        4. Now that Goose has browser capabilities, let's resume your last session:
        ```sh
         goose session -r
        ```
        5. Ask Goose to launch your game in a browser:
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```
open index.html in a browser
```

Go ahead and play your game, I know you want to 😂 ... good luck!


## Next Steps
Congrats, you've successfully used Goose to develop a web app! 🎉

Here are some ideas for next steps:
* Continue your session with Goose and it improve your game (styling, functionality, etc).
* Browse other available [extensions][extensions-guide] and install more to enhance Goose's functionality even further.
* Provide Goose with a [set of hints](/docs/guides/using-goosehints) to use within your sessions.
