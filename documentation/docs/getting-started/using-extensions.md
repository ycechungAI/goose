Extensions are add-ons that provide a way to extend the functionality of Goose by connecting with applications and tools you already use in your workflow. These extensions can be used to add new features, access data and resources, or integrate with other systems.

Extensions are based on the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol), so you can connect
Goose to a wide ecosystem of capabilities.

:::tip Tutorials
Check out the [step-by-step tutorials](/docs/category/mcp-servers) for adding and using several Goose Extensions
:::


## Built-in Extensions
Out of the box, Goose is installed with a few extensions but with only the `Developer` extension enabled by default.

Here are the built-in extensions:

- [Developer](/docs/mcp/developer-mcp): Provides a set of general development tools that are useful for software development.
- [Computer Controller](/docs/mcp/computer-controller-mcp): Provides general computer control tools for webscraping, file caching, and automations.
- [Memory](/docs/mcp/memory-mcp): Teaches Goose to remember your preferences as you use it.
- [Tutorial](/docs/mcp/tutorial-mcp): Provides interactive tutorials for learning about Goose.

:::info
All of Goose's built-in extensions are MCP servers in their own right. If you'd like
to use the MCP servers included with Goose with any other agent, you are free to do so.
:::


## Discovering Extensions

Goose provides a [central directory][extensions-directory] of extensions that you can install and use. 

You can also add any other [MCP Server](#mcp-servers) as a Goose extension, even if it's not listed in our directory.


## Adding Extensions

Extensions can be installed directly via the [extensions directory][extensions-directory], CLI, or UI.

### MCP Servers

You can install any MCP server as a Goose extension. 

:::tip MCP Server Directory
See available servers in the **[MCP Server Directory](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers)**.

### Deeplinks

Extensions can be installed using Goose's deep link protocol. The URL format varies based on the extension type:

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="stdio" label="StandardIO" default>
```
goose://extension?cmd=<command>&arg=<argument>&id=<id>&name=<name>&description=<description>
```

Required parameters:
- `cmd`: The base command to run, one of `jbang`, `npx`, `uvx`, `goosed`, or `docker`
- `arg`: (cmd only) Command arguments (can be repeated for multiple arguments: `&arg=...&arg=...`)
- `timeout`: Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for extension responses
- `id`: Unique identifier for the extension
- `name`: Display name for the extension
- `description`: Brief description of the extension's functionality

A command like `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github` would be represented as:

```
goose://extension?cmd=npx&arg=-y&arg=%40modelcontextprotocol/server-github&timeout=<timeout>&id=<id>&name=<name>&description=<description>
```

Note that each parameter to the `npx` command is passed as a separate `arg` parameter in the deeplink.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sse" label="Server-Sent Events">
```
goose://extension?url=<remote-sse-url>&id=<id>&name=<name>&description=<description>
```

Parameters:
- `url`: The URL of the remote SSE server
- `timeout`: Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for extension responses
- `id`: Unique identifier for the extension
- `name`: Display name for the extension
- `description`: Brief description of the extension's functionality

For example, a deeplink for a URL like `http://localhost:8080/sse` would look like this when URL-encoded:

```
goose://extension?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Fsse&timeout=<timeout>&id=<id>&name=<name>&description=<description>>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="streamable_http" label="Streaming HTTP">
```
goose://extension?url=<remote-streamable-http-url>&type=streamable_http&id=<id>&name=<n>&description=<description>
```

Parameters:
- `url`: The URL of the remote Streaming HTTP server
- `type`: Must be set to `streamable_http` to specify the protocol type
- `timeout`: Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for extension responses
- `id`: Unique identifier for the extension
- `name`: Display name for the extension
- `description`: Brief description of the extension's functionality

For example, a deeplink for a URL like `https://example.com/streamable` would look like this when URL-encoded:

```
goose://extension?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fstreamable&type=streamable_http&timeout=<timeout>&id=<id>&name=<n>&description=<description>
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
All parameters in the deeplink must be URL-encoded. For example, spaces should be replaced with `%20`, and `@` should be replaced with `%40`.
:::


### Config Entry
For advanced users, you can also directly edit the config file (`~/.config/goose/config.yaml`) to add, remove, or update an extension:

```yaml
extensions:
  github:
    name: GitHub
    cmd: npx
    args: [-y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github]
    enabled: true
    envs: { "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>" }
    type: stdio
    timeout: 300
```
    

## Enabling/Disabling Extensions

You can enable or disable installed extensions based on your workflow needs.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
  1. Click the <PanelLeft className="inline" size={16} /> button in the top-left to open the sidebar.
  2. Click the `Extensions` button on the sidebar.
  2. Use the toggle switch next to each extension to enable or disable it.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
    1. Run the following command to open up Goose's configurations:
    ```sh
    goose configure
    ```
    2. Select `Toggle Extensions` from the menu.
    3. A list of already installed extensions will populate.
    4. Press the `space bar` to toggle the extension. Solid means enabled. 

    **Example:**

    ```
    ┌   goose-configure 
    │
    ◇  What would you like to configure?
    │  Toggle Extensions 
    │
    ◆  enable extensions: (use "space" to toggle and "enter" to submit)
    │  ◼ developer 
    │  ◻ fetch 
    └   
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Automatically Enabled Extensions

The Smart Extension Recommendation system in Goose automatically identifies and suggests relevant extensions based on your tasks and needs. This section explains how to use this feature effectively and understand its capabilities and limitations.

When you request a task, Goose checks its enabled extensions and their tools to determine if it can fulfill the request. If not, it suggests or enables additional extensions as needed. You can also request specific extensions by name.


:::warning
Any extensions enabled dynamically are only enabled for the current session. To keep extensions enabled between sessions, see [Enabling/Disabling Extensions](#enablingdisabling-extensions).
:::

### Automatic Detection

Goose automatically detects when an extension is needed based on your task requirements. Here's an example of how Goose identifies and enables a needed extension during a conversation:

<Tabs groupId="interface">
<TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>

#### Goose Prompt
```plaintext
Find all orders with pending status from our production database
```

#### Goose Output

```plaintext
I'll help you search for available extensions that might help us interact with PostgreSQL databases.

🔍 Search Available Extensions
└─ Output ▼

 I see there's a PostgreSQL extension available. Let me enable it so we can query your database.

🔧 Manage Extensions
└─ action           enable
   extension_name   postgresql

The extension 'postgresql' has been installed successfully

Great! Now I can help you query the database...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">

#### Goose Prompt
```plaintext
Find all orders with pending status from our production database
```

#### Goose Output

```sh
I apologize, but I notice that I don't currently have access to your database. Let me search if there are any database-related extensions available.
─── search_available_extensions | platform ──────────────────────────

I see that there is a "postgresql" extension available. Let me enable it so I can help you query your database.
─── enable_extension | platform ──────────────────────────
extension_name: postgresql


■  Goose would like to enable the following extension, do you approve?
// highlight-start
| ● Yes, for this session 
// highlight-end
| ○ No
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Direct Request

Goose responds to explicit requests for extensions, allowing users to manually enable specific tools they need. Here's an example of how Goose handles a direct request to enable an extension:

<Tabs groupId="interface">
<TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>

#### Goose Prompt

```plaintext

■  Goose would like to enable the following extension, do you approve?
// highlight-start
| ● Yes, for this session 
// highlight-end
| ○ No
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Updating Extension Properties

Goose relies on extension properties to determine how to handle an extension. You can edit these properties if you want to change the extension's display settings and behavior, such as the name, timeout, or environment variables.

    ◆  Select extensions to remove (note: you can only remove disabled extensions - use "space" to toggle and "enter" to submit)
    │  ◼ fetch 
    └  
    ```
    5. Press Enter to save
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Starting Session with Extensions

You can start a tailored Goose session with specific extensions directly from the CLI. 

:::info Notes
* The extension will not be installed. It will only be enabled for the current session.
* There's no need to do this if you already have the extensions enabled.
:::

### Built-in Extensions

To enable a built-in extension while starting a session, run the following command:

```bash
goose session --with-builtin "{extension_id}"
```

For example, to enable the Developer and Computer Controller extensions and start a session, you'd run:

```bash
goose session --with-builtin "developer,computercontroller"
```

Or alternatively:

```bash
goose session --with-builtin developer --with-builtin computercontroller
```


### External Extensions

To enable an extension while starting a session, run the following command:

```bash
goose session --with-extension "{extension command}" --with-extension "{another extension command}"
```

For example, to start a session with the [Fetch extension](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch), you'd run:

```bash
goose session --with-extension "uvx mcp-server-fetch"
```


#### Environment Variables

Some extensions require environment variables. You can include these in your command:

```bash
goose session --with-extension "VAR=value command arg1 arg2"
```

For example, to start a session with the [GitHub extension](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github), you'd run:

```bash
goose session --with-extension "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN> npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
```

:::info
Note that you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system to run this command, as it uses `npx`.
:::


### Remote Extensions over SSE

To enable a remote extension over SSE while starting a session, run the following command:

```bash
goose session --with-remote-extension "{extension URL}" --with-remote-extension "{another extension URL}"
```

For example, to start a session with a remote extension over SSE running on localhost on port 8080, you'd run:

```bash
goose session --with-remote-extension "http://localhost:8080/sse"
```

### Remote Extensions over Streaming HTTP

To enable a remote extension over Streaming HTTP while starting a session, run the following command:

```bash
goose session --with-streamable-http-extension "{extension URL}" --with-streamable-http-extension "{another extension URL}"
```

For example, to start a session with a Streaming HTTP extension, you'd run:

```bash
goose session --with-streamable-http-extension "https://example.com/streamable"
```

## Developing Extensions

Goose extensions are implemented with MCP, a standard protocol that allows AI models and agents to securely connect with local or remote resources. Learn how to build your own [extension as an MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server).
