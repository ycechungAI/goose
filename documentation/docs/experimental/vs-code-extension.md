### Goose Prompt

```
Update the contributing guide at /goose/CONTRIBUTING.md with instructions on how to start docusaurus dev server
```

### Goose Output

```

I'll help you update the CONTRIBUTING.md file with instructions for starting the Docusaurus dev server. First, let me check the current content of the file.

─── developer__text_editor | view ──────────────────────────

I'll now update the CONTRIBUTING.md file to include instructions for starting the Docusaurus dev server. I'll add this information in a new section under the Node section.

─── developer__text_editor | str_replace ──────────────────────────

I've successfully updated the CONTRIBUTING.md file to include instructions for starting the Docusaurus dev server. I added a new "Documentation" section right after the Node section, which provides clear step-by-step instructions for:

Navigating to the docs directory
Installing dependencies
Starting the development server
I also included helpful information about the hot-reloading feature and the local server URL. The formatting is consistent with the rest of the document, using proper markdown syntax for code blocks and headers.

Is there anything else you'd like me to add or modify in the contributing guide?
